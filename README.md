To build an admission form for Yoga Classes in React, I would start by creating a new React project using the create-react-app command-line interface. Then, I would create a new component for the admission form, which would contain a form with fields for the user's name, email, age, and selected batch.

Next, I would add basic validation to the form to make sure that the user is within the age limit of 18-65, and that all required fields are filled out. I would also add logic to calculate the monthly fee of 500/- Rs INR, and to call the CompletePayment() function to process the payment.

Once the form is working properly, I would create a REST API endpoint to accept the user data and store it in a database. The database would need to have tables for storing user information, payment information, and batch information. Here is an example of an ER diagram for the database design:
                              +-------------+
                               |    USERS    |
                               +-------------+
                               | id          |
                               | name        |
                               | email       |
                               | age         |
                               | batch_id    |
                               +-------------+
                               +-------------+
                                     |
                                     |
                                     |
                           +----------+----------+
                           |                      |
                           |                      |
                           |                      |
                  +-------------+           +-------------+
                  |   PAYMENTS   |           |   BATCHES   |
                  +-------------+           +-------------+
                  | id          |           | id          |
                  | user_id     |           | start_time  |
                  | amount      |           | end_time    |
                  | date        |           | capacity    |
                  +-------------+           +-------------+
The USERS table would store information about each user, such as their name, email, age, and the ID of the batch they are enrolled in. The PAYMENTS table would store information about each payment, such as the user's ID, the payment amount, and the date of the payment. The BATCHES table would store information about each batch, such as the start and end times, and the capacity of the batch.

Once the database is set up, I would implement the REST API endpoint to accept user data from the admission form, validate the data, and store it in the database. The API would also call the CompletePayment() function to process the payment, and return the response to the frontend depending on the payment response.

Overall, building the admission form and REST API for Yoga Classes would involve creating a React form, implementing basic validation and payment processing, and setting up a database and API endpoint to store and manage user data.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
