#                                                Building the web app for the Yoga Classes 
To build an admission form for Yoga Classes in React, I would start by creating a new React project using the create-react-app command-line interface. Then, I would create a new component for the admission form, which would contain a form with fields for the user's name, email, age, and selected batch.

Next, I would add basic validation to the form to make sure that the user is within the age limit of 18-65, and that all required fields are filled out. I would also add logic to calculate the monthly fee of 500/- Rs INR, and to call the CompletePayment() function to process the payment.

Once the form is working properly, I would create a REST API endpoint to accept the user data and store it in a database. The database would need to have tables for storing user information, payment information, and batch information. Here is an example of an ER diagram for the database design:

                               +-------------+
                               |    USERS    |
                               +-------------+
                               | id          |
                               | name        |
                               | email       |
                               | age         |
                               | batch_id    |
                               +-------------+
                                     |
                                     |
                                     |
                           +----------+----------+
                           |                      |
                           |                      |
                           |                      |
                  +-------------+           +-------------+
                  |   PAYMENTS   |           |   BATCHES   |
                  +-------------+           +-------------+
                  | id          |           | id          |
                  | user_id     |           | start_time  |
                  | amount      |           | end_time    |
                  | date        |           | capacity    |
                  +-------------+           +-------------+
The USERS table would store information about each user, such as their name, email, age, and the ID of the batch they are enrolled in. The PAYMENTS table would store information about each payment, such as the user's ID, the payment amount, and the date of the payment. The BATCHES table would store information about each batch, such as the start and end times, and the capacity of the batch.

Once the database is set up, I would implement the REST API endpoint to accept user data from the admission form, validate the data, and store it in the database. The API would also call the CompletePayment() function to process the payment, and return the response to the frontend depending on the payment response.

Overall, building the admission form and REST API for Yoga Classes would involve creating a React form, implementing basic validation and payment processing, and setting up a database and API endpoint to store and manage user data.
