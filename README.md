To build an admission form for Yoga Classes in React, I would start by creating a new React project using the create-react-app command-line interface. Then, I would create a new component for the admission form, which would contain a form with fields for the user's name, email, age, and selected batch.

Next, I would add basic validation to the form to make sure that the user is within the age limit of 18-65, and that all required fields are filled out. I would also add logic to calculate the monthly fee of 500/- Rs INR, and to call the CompletePayment() function to process the payment.

Once the form is working properly, I would create a REST API endpoint to accept the user data and store it in a database. The database would need to have tables for storing user information, payment information, and batch information. Here is an example of an ER diagram for the database design:

                               +-------------+
                               |    USERS    |
                               +-------------+
                               | id          |
                               | name        |
                               | email       |
                               | age         |
                               | batch_id    |
                               +-------------+
                                     |
                                     |
                                     |
                           +----------+----------+
                           |                      |
                           |                      |
                           |                      |
                  +-------------+           +-------------+
                  |   PAYMENTS   |           |   BATCHES   |
                  +-------------+           +-------------+
                  | id          |           | id          |
                  | user_id     |           | start_time  |
                  | amount      |           | end_time    |
                  | date        |           | capacity    |
                  +-------------+           +-------------+
The USERS table would store information about each user, such as their name, email, age, and the ID of the batch they are enrolled in. The PAYMENTS table would store information about each payment, such as the user's ID, the payment amount, and the date of the payment. The BATCHES table would store information about each batch, such as the start and end times, and the capacity of the batch.

Once the database is set up, I would implement the REST API endpoint to accept user data from the admission form, validate the data, and store it in the database. The API would also call the CompletePayment() function to process the payment, and return the response to the frontend depending on the payment response.

Overall, building the admission form and REST API for Yoga Classes would involve creating a React form, implementing basic validation and payment processing, and setting up a database and API endpoint to store and manage user data.



To set up the backend for the admission form in Firebase, you can use the Firebase Realtime Database to store the user data. The database schema for the admission form would look something like this:

Copy code
admissionForm
  - userId
    - name: "John Doe"
    - age: 30
    - contact_number: "+1 123-456-7890"
    - email: "johndoe@example.com"
    - batch: "6-7AM"
In this schema, each user's data is stored under a unique user ID, which can be generated using the push() method of the Firebase Realtime Database. The user data includes the name, age, contact number, email, and batch of the user.

To set up the backend in Firebase, you can follow these steps:

Create a new Firebase project on the Firebase website.

Install the Firebase CLI and login to your Firebase account using the firebase login command.

Initialize your Firebase project by running the firebase init command and selecting the Realtime Database option.

Write the code for the backend API that will handle the user data and store it in the Firebase Realtime Database. This code will need to handle the following:

Accepting the user data from the frontend form.
Validating the user data to ensure that it is valid.
Generating a unique user ID using the push() method of the Realtime Database.
Storing the user data in the Realtime Database under the generated user ID.
Returning a response to the frontend depending on the result of the database operation.
Deploy the backend API to Firebase using the firebase deploy command.

Once the backend is set up, you can use the frontend form to submit user data and make a call to the backend API to handle the data and store it in the database.
